# FHHardlang
I will design and implement a programming language in this repo. Its name is Hardlang.

## Planed Features
### Making clear difference from functions and procedures
Functions map input to output, where procedures do something.

### Combining interface to a existing object at runtime
func foo(int a);
val b: double;
val newb = b fit int {eval: ???}
